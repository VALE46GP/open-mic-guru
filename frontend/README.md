# Authentication Flow Documentation

This document outlines the authentication flow for the Express.js backend and React frontend of our application, detailing both code comments and README instructions to ensure clarity and ease of use for developers.

## Backend (Express.js)

### Code Comments

- **Routes (`routes/auth.js`)**: Each route is documented to explain its purpose, the authentication strategy used (e.g., Google OAuth), and any middleware applied.
- **Middleware (`middleware/verifyToken.js`)**: Custom middleware for token verification is documented, explaining its role in protecting routes.
- **Passport Configuration**: The configuration of Passport strategies, including environment variables and callback functions, is explained.

### README Instructions

- **Environment Variables**: List all necessary environment variables such as `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `JWT_SECRET`.
- **Setup Steps**: Provide detailed steps for setting up the authentication strategy, including registering the application with Google to obtain client ID and secret.
- **Endpoints**: Document the authentication endpoints (`/auth/google`, `/auth/google/callback`), their HTTP methods, and expected request/response formats.

## Frontend (React)

### Code Comments

- **Context/Provider (`src/context/AuthContext.js`)**: The `AuthContext` provides authentication state and functions (login, logout) across the application. Each function and state variable is documented.
- **Hooks (`src/hooks/useAuth.js`)**: Custom hooks for accessing authentication state and performing actions are explained.
- **Components (`src/pages/LoginPage.js`)**: Components related to authentication, like `LoginPage`, include comments on form handling, state management, and backend interaction.

### README Instructions

- **Authentication Flow**: Describe the user experience of authentication, including login, logout, and navigation through protected routes.
- **Protected Routes**: Explain the implementation and usage of `ProtectedRoute` components to restrict access based on authentication state.
- **Environment Setup**: Mention any necessary configurations for the frontend to communicate with the backend, such as the backend URL.

By adhering to these documentation practices, developers can quickly understand and effectively work with the authentication flow in the application.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
